# A-Frame: Pro Mode

This presentation was given at an [Immersive NYC](https://www.meetup.com/Immersive-NYC/) meet-up, [A-Frame 104 Workshop: Dissecting a data visualization project](https://www.meetup.com/Immersive-NYC/events/254272116/) as a case study on an A-Frame XR prototype. The prototype was originally built on a hackathon, and this segment of the workshop reviewed steps taken to improve the prototype for user experience, performance and maintainability.
